				<h2><a href="#">Census Sampling <br />
					  causes lost <br />
										representativeness</a></h2>
				<p>Traditional sampling for household survey is done using government censuses,
					which can be outdated, or even deliberately underrepresenting certain populations,
					rapid urbanisation further exacerbates unrepresentativeness.

			<p>SatSampling uses high-resolution satellite imagery in combination with
					Artificial Intelligence algorithms, in order to identify all dwellings,
					this (literally) ground-up approach, creates truely unbias samples, making surveys
					more representative than every before.

		<h3>Decades Out of Date</h3>

		<h3>Deliberate Exclusion</h3>
		<p>Censuses might have deliberately excluded vulnerable populations, be in by government or other forces.</p>

		<h3>Unrepresented Populations</h3>
		<p>For reasons such as these and more, census-based surveys exclude large swaths of the population,
